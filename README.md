# Exploring-SpaceX-Launch-Data-A-Machine-Learning-Approach
The business problem that this project aimed to solve was to predict whether SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage would land successfully or not. The project analyzed SpaceX launches and identified the factors affecting the success of rocket launches. Machine learning models such as Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were applied to predict the outcome. The project also helped me learn several skills such as data collection, wrangling, formatting, exploratory data analysis, interactive data visualization, and machine learning prediction.
Skills Learned
During this project, I learned the following skills:
•	Data collection, wrangling, and formatting
•	Exploratory data analysis
•	Interactive data visualization
•	Machine learning prediction
Machine Learning Models Used
I used several machine learning classification algorithms to predict if the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage would land successfully. These algorithms include:
•	Decision Tree
•	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
•	Logistic Regression
•	Support Vector Machine (SVM)
